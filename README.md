Hi, my name is Melody!


- 🔭 I’m currently working on furthering my skill set by attening the app/Academy online Software Engineer Bootcamp.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, Python, React, Redux, SQL, and more!
- 🤔 I’m looking to engage with developers who want to share their knowledge with a fresh dev and help me be a smarter programmer. In return, I don't mind writing code based on directions given. Fair trade is important to me!
- 💬 AMA, Like most people, I don't mind talking about myself(within reason I think).
- 🏠 Currenlty I live in Dallas, TX which is also where I was born. I've also lived in Grand Junction, CO and Ft. Walton Beach, FL. 
- 📫 How to reach me: melodylayne79@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: My pronouns are She | Her | Hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I lived on the island of Key West for a month a few years ago. It was fantastic!
