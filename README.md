Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- 🔭 I’m currently working on furthering my skill set by attening the app/Academy online Software Engineer Bootcamp.

- 🤔 I’m looking to engage with developers who want to share their knowledge with a fresh dev and help me be a smarter programmer. In return, I don't mind writing code based on directions given. Fair trade is important to me!
- 💬 AMA, Like most people, I don't mind talking about myself(within reason I think).
