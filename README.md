- 🔭 I’m currently working on furthering my skill set by attening the app/Academy online Software Engineer Bootcamp.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, Python, React, Redux, SQL, and more!

- 💬 AMA, Like most people, I don't mind talking about myself(within reason I think).
- 🏠 Currenlty I live in Dallas, TX which is also where I was born. I've also lived in Grand Junction, CO and Ft. Walton Beach, FL.
